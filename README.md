`SCCion` has always been an experimental project for my PhD and is not maintained or continued. I want to point to the excellent [`Bactopia`](https://github.com/bactopia/bactopia) and  [`Staphopia`](https://github.com/staphopia) by [@rpetit3](https://github.com/bactopia/bactopia) for better analysis options for _S. aureus_ :grapes:
