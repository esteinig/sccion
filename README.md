# SCCion

SCC*mec* typing for MRSA

Simple program to determine staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCC*mec*) types and subtypes for methicillin resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (and potentially *Staphylococcus spp.*) from whole genome sequencing data. Current version can distinguish main types (I - XII) from single-end and paired-end Illumina reads (except SCC*mec*-VII) and from high-quality assembled genomes.
